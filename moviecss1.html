		<p>Trolls is an animated film that tells the story of ever happy Trolls, and the depressed Bergens that try to eat them in order to feel happy. The movie follows the adventure of princess Poppy and the one sad troll, Branch as they must journey to the Bergen's lair to rescue their friends before they become dinner. It's a great movie for the kids, but also has some aspects and subtle nods that older generations will also enjoy.</p>
