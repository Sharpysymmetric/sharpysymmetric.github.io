            <H1>What is Android?</H1>
            <br>
            <p class="scrollbox">Android is the most popular mobile operating in the world. Boasting 1 Billion plus users, and a wide range of devices that span every price group and style one can imagine has helped the system grow and take up home in many people's pockets. This huge pool of users also creates a huge pool of potential targets for would be hackers. This larger user base is not the only reason Android is seen as the more vulnerable of the mobile operating systems when compared to its rival Apple and iOS. This appearance of being more vulnerable is not wihtout some valid evidence to support it. Open Source software is free for anyone to see the code that makes that particular program or system functin. The fact that these are publicly available codes, that means that any potential exploits that a hacker may use are also publicly available. There are some steps you can take to help protect your Android device from would be data thieves.</p>

        <ol>
        <li>The first thing to remember is that Android phones (at least those running anything newer than lollipop) have to ability to be encrypted. This means that should someone get your device they could not get to the data stored on your phone unless they found access to your password. Encryption is like scrambling all of your data and your password is the key that unscrambles it. Should your device be stolen the would be thieves will be left with very little that they can get from the phone without a password.</li>
            
        <li>Android is a open platform, in more ways than one. One aspect of this that helps set Android apart from Apple's iOS is the fact that it is possible to side load apps. This means installing apps from Third party sources (not the Google Play Store). THIS IS NOT A GOOD THING. Apps on the Play Store are subject to screening and scrutiny to help reduce the amount of malware that could potentially reach unaware users.</li>
            
        <li>Update your Android Phone with the latest security update as soon as you can. Android now releases monthly updates for the security of devices which helps to keep your phone safe from attackers even if you have a device that is unlikely to receive any further OS upgrades.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This video shows a proof of concept of obtaining <a href="what_is_root_and_jailbreak.html">Root</a> via a privilege escalation (obtaining administrator rights and access) exploiting a bug in the Android(linux) kernel that is in charge of alot of the low level programs and functions of your phone, such as turning on when you press a button, controling aspects of the phone's hardware, etc. </p>
