				Album Review
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<dl>
					<li><dt>Revolutions Per Minute</dt></li>
						<dd>Rise Against's sophmore album takes their music out of the hardcore "screamo" and into a more modern punk styling. While
				hard core elements remain a feature of this album, it is more subdued than before. They also incorporate some political themes
				in their songs, such as Black Masks and Gasoline, which becomes a major theme for the band throughout their career.</dd>
					<li><dt>The Sufferer and The Witness</dt></li>
						<dd>The Sufferer and the Witness could be seen as the bands true coming of age moment. This album features songs with a clean
					cut feel and production style. It also includes many of the band's most famous songs including Prayer of the Refugee and Ready to Fall.
					This album is full of amazing songs that show the talent of the band at their best.</dd>
					<li><dt>The Black Market</dt></li>
						<dd>Rise Against's newest album is their most politically oriented and while the themes in the songs themselves are typical to the bands style
						some of their songs seem to lose a bit of the bands musical flair in order to convey a message. While this may not be their best album, it
						does contain songs, that while not their best, are still very good such as, People Live Here.</dd>
