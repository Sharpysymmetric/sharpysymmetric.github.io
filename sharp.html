		<h1>Austin Sharp</h1>
		<p>Hello there! I'm twenty three years old and am in school trying to pursue a career in computer programming. I have dabbled in a little bit of web development and java programming, and am hoping to get a real education in these areas. As far as hobbies I like to hang out with my three year old son and go to the park and on walks. I'm hoping that by pursuing a career that is in a field I'm passionate about I will be able to enjoy what I do, and that it will help me to provide my son a better future.</p>
